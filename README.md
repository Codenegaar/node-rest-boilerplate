# node-rest-boilerplate

A simple boilerplate for Node RESTful APIs. Still a work in progress.

## Tech-stack

A brief overview of technologies and tools used in this boilerplate, 
and how to disable them.

### PM2

PM2 is a process management tool suitable for Node environments. I'll
take you to [their own webpage](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to learn more.

The project's process configuration can be found in the file `ecosystem.config.js`. 
If you don't want to use PM2, simply ignore/delete this file, as well as the dependency on
the `pm2` package:

`npm uninstall pm2`
